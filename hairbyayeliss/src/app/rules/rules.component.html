      <p class="card-text important">THERE IS A 15 MINUTE LATE FEE REQUIREMENT. Meaning : IF YOU ARE 15 minutes late to your appointment it is a $20 late fee if I am still able to take you after your appointment time. Your appointment will be cancelled <u>after</u> 20 minutes and you must reschedule for another date and time on the site. This is not fair to my clients who have scheduled appointments back to back , no exceptions..</p>
